Problem:
The Plant Manager develops an engineered formula in Microsoft Excel to simplify the calculation of Metal Coil's weight, length, thickness, and width. 
However, access to the Excel sheet is limited, and manual calculations can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The sales team, machine operators, and 
inventory personnel need a more accessible and efficient tool to perform these calculations.

Solution:
I developed a mobile application that incorporates the same formulas, making it easy for all employees to perform accurate calculations quickly and conveniently. 
The app not only streamlines the calculation process but also helps reduce work time and improves reporting efficiency. This ensures consistent data, 
minimizes errors, and enhances overall productivity across departments.
